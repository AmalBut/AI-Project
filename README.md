## ðŸ§  How the AI Works

The gameâ€™s AI is powered by the **Minimax Algorithm**, a decision-making strategy used in games. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Thinks Ahead**:
   - The AI looks at all possible moves and their outcomes up to a certain depth.
2. **Scores Moves**:
   - Winning moves get the highest score, losing moves get the lowest, and neutral moves are in between.
3. **Chooses the Best Move**:
   - It picks the move that gives it the best chance to win or blocks the player from winning.

This makes the AI challenging and fun to play against! ðŸŽ‰
